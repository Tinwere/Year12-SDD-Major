        <h1> Birthday Scheduler Issues </h1>
         <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>1. Why in some of the cells does it say "#REF" instead of the names and/or dates?</h2>
            <p> This error message in the cell comes up as the formula is not reading the correct data. Ensure that the information from the TASS list was correctly copied into the spreadsheet in the format, "lastname, firstname" and "DD/MM/YYYY". Also make sure that the words are in the font "Ariel" as this is the default font used in Google Spreadsheets.</p>

         <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>2. I have put the courseID number in the "Desired Classroom Course ID:" cell and have clicked "Schedule Birthday". Why has nothing appeared to be scheduled on the classroom?</h2>
            <p> Ensure that the courseID number matches with the classroom name that you wish to post in. It may have scheduled in the wrong classroom or might not have been the correct courseID number if it was not copied into the cell properly. Alternately, try reloading the classroom page again as it may not have updated properly.</p>

            <h2>3. I have recieved an error message at the top screen that reads: "GoogleJsonResponseException: API call to classroom.courses.announcements.create failed with error:". How can I fix this issue?</h2>
            <p> The error message pops up as the "Desired Classroom Course ID:" cell is not filled with a courseID. Ensure that you have put the desired courseID into the cell before attempting to schedule the birthdays.</p>
